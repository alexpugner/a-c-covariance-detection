Detecting and Dissecting A-C covariance in Extended Twin-Family Design

In the literature, many models have been proposed to account for cov(AC) in twin models,
whether it comes from cultural transmission or sibling interaction (see. Keller et. al., 2009;
Eaves, 1976). Incorporating polygenic risk scores is a useful method to
account for the covariance between additive genetic variables and shared environmental
variables (see Dolan et. al., 2021; Selzam et. al., 2019; Kong et. Al., 2018; Bates et. Al., 2018
and Okbay et. Al., 2022). However, the major shortcoming of these models is that they cannot
account for the source of cov(AC), i.e., cultural transmission or sibling interaction. Therefore,
the present aim is to propose a parent-sibling model using polygenic risk scores that combine
the models proposed in the literature to distinguish these sources of cov(AC) and to investigate
the power to determine whether cov(AC) stems from sibling-interaction, cultural transmission,
or both sources. Based on the simulated data, we fitted Generalized Estimation Equation
regression models and tested their power to reject the null hypothesis in various scenarios. The
tests were conducted in a dataset consisting of DZ family data and in a dataset consisting of
MZ and DZ family data. Our results suggest that the model detects cov(AC) with a power that
ranges from 0.7 to 1 in most scenarios, where cov(AC) is present, the resolution of the model
is considered high. However, one major shortcoming of the model is that if both sources are
present (cultural transmission and sibling interaction), its power is strongly dependent on the
value of the cov(AC) effects. Further finding is that the power is not dependent on the sizes of
the A, C, and E variance components. However further research with larger computational
power is needed to further elaborate these findings.
